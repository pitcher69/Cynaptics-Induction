# ⚖️ CYNAPTICS INDUCTION - AGENTS OF JUSTICE

Welcome to my submission for the **Cynaptics Hackathon**!  
This project simulates a courtroom environment using LLM agents, and also explores how AI can predict legal verdicts using case data.

---

## 🔧 Initial Problem Statement

The task was to **simulate a courtroom environment** using AI agents that represent real courtroom roles such as:
- Judge 👨‍⚖️
- Plaintiff 👤
- Defendant 🙋
- Prosecutor ⚔️
- Defense Lawyer 🛡️
- Witness 🧍

The goal was to build a believable, multi-agent legal proceeding using LLMs to mimic real-world behavior and reasoning in trials.

## 🤖 Agents of Justice — Courtroom Simulation

The courtroom simulation follows a structured, realistic flow:
1. 👨‍⚖️ **Judge** introduces the case.
2. ⚔️ **Prosecution** makes an opening statement.
3. 🛡️ **Defense Lawyer** responds.
4. 🧍 **Witness** is interrogated and cross-examined.
5. 🧑‍⚖️ **Closing statements** from both sides.
6. 👨‍⚖️ **Judge** delivers a final verdict.

Each agent uses role-specific prompts and interacts with the case data independently.

## 🧪 Kaggle Attempt 1 – Basic Verdict Prediction

Once the courtroom logic was working, I explored **verdict prediction** as a separate experiment on Kaggle.

- I initially ignored the 5-agent requirement to get a baseline working model.
- Tested multiple APIs:
  - ❌ `langchain-openai`: Frequent rate limits (`429` errors).
  - ⚠️ `HuggingFace`: Limited to inputs <8192 tokens, but real cases were >25k characters.
  - ✅ **Google Gemini API**: Successfully handled long cases using `gemini-1.5-flash` and `gemini-2.0-flash`.

### Strategy:
- Single-agent simulation (Judge only).
- Batched input cases in groups of 3–4 to avoid rate limits.
- Verdict generated based on single-agent judgment.

## 🧪 Kaggle Attempt 2 – Multi-Agent Verdict Voting

To meet the original requirement of **5 agents**, I evolved the architecture:

### Improvements:
- Added agents:
  - 👨‍⚖️ Judge
  - 👤 Plaintiff
  - ⚔️ Prosecutor
  - 🙋 Defendant
  - 🛡️ Defense Lawyer

### Method:
- Each agent individually reviews the case.
- Final verdict is determined by **majority voting**.

### Limitations:
- Not a dynamic simulation; agents do not interact with each other.
- No memory or conversational history used.
- Future improvement would involve building a **turn-based system with message passing** between agents.

## 🗂️ Data Usage

# Courtroom Simulation Project - Initial Setup

## Overview
This project simulates courtroom scenarios and predicts verdicts (GRANTED/1 or DENIED/0) based on case descriptions. The initial setup prepares the necessary files and configuration before running the simulation.

## Initial Setup (PS)

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following files are in the **same directory**:
- `data.csv` - Contains the dataset with case descriptions and verdicts.
- `.env` - Environment variables for API keys 
- `law3.py` - The Python script that processes the cases.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   Ensure you have all the required project files and place them in the same directory.

2. **Replace API-key and File Paths**
   Use the Gemini API key generated by you in the .env file, and replace file paths where needed in law3.py file

3. **Run the Code**
   Simply input a valid test case number and enjoy the courtroom simulation


## KAGGLE ATTEMPTS

### Prerequisites
Ensure the following files are in the **same directory**:
- `cases.csv` - Contains the dataset with case descriptions and verdicts.
- `justice-1.py` - The Python script that processes the cases.
- `justice-1.py` - The Python script that processes the cases with multiple agents.
- `submissions.csv` - Empty file, which will be filled with verdics of cases chosen by you

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   Ensure you have all the required project files and place them in the same directory.

2. **Replace API-key and File Paths**
   Use the Gemini API key generated by you and replace file paths where needed in law3.py file

3. **Run the Code**
   To avoid API Limits, input the starting row index and ending row index(preferable below 5 rows) and observe the results in the `submissions.csv` file
